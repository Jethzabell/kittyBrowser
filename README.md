# Kitty Browser

[CryptoKitties](http://cryptokitties.co) is one of the most popular distributed apps on the Ethereum Network. It's a game that allows players to purchase, collect, breed and sell various types of virtual cats.

To be able to run CryptoKitties on your browser you'll need to install [Metamask](http://metamask.io/) or use a dedicated Ethereum browser like Mist or Parity.
